This is a project funded by a Grífols Research Grant in Bioethics from the _Fundació Víctor Grífols i Lucas_.

The main aim of this project is to explore whether people with somatic and psychiatric conditions are given less credibility than their healthy counterparts due to identity prejudice, and if so, to investigate under which conditions this is the case. To achieve this, we use experimental methodology, particularly vignette-based studies. We hope that this will allow us to complement the existing empirical evidence gathered through interviews, conversation analysis and questionnaires, among other methods.
