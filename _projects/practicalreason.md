### Introduction

<b>What does it mean to be a reasonable person?</b> We often encounter situations in which something seems reasonable: it feels intuitive, advisable and desirable. But what does it mean to be reasonable? In law, the term 'reasonable person' is a legal fiction used to determine how a prudent and rational individual would act in certain situations {% cite bongiovanni2009reasonableness %}. However, since the end of the last century, this term has been used considerably more frequently in everyday language {% cite tobia2018reasonableness --locator 353 %}.

There has been a long-standing debate about how this legal fiction and lay usage are formed. According to Holmes {% cite holmes1881commonlaw %} the concept of <b>reasonableness can be defined as the average</b>, which is determined by the habitual actions of real people. Conversely, alternative proposals regard <b>reasonableness as prescriptive</b>, i.e. as a moral order based on a particular moral principle. However, recent research posits that the phenomenon may be defined by a <b>combination of both influences</b>. Tobia proposes a dual perspective of reasonableness, positing that it should not be regarded as purely descriptive or prescriptive, but rather as a hybrid judgement that incorporates statistical and prescriptive considerations {% cite tobia2018reasonableness --locator 45 %}.

A parallel approach has been proposed for what we think is <b>'normal'</b>. Some research propose that what we thingk is normal is a hybridisation of frequencies from a single descriptive-prescriptive spectrum. The approaches to the descriptive-prescriptive divide vary; some are guided by concepts such as 'the good' and 'the common' {% cite wysocki2020normality %}, while others are informed by concepts such as 'the average' and 'the ideal' {% cite bear2017normality %}. In essence, what is considered normal can be regarded as a combination of what is common or average, and what is good or ideal.

#### Our research

<b>In this project</b>, we are investigating how these four concept: average, ideal, normal and reasonable, can be understood in relation to each other. We are examining them in terms of <b>frequency estimation</b> ([study one](#study-one), i.e. what is the average/ideal/reasonable/normal amount of different things) <b>evaluation</b> ([study two](#study-two), i.e. how favourably or unfavourably these frequencies are), and how <b>cognitive accessibility</b> ([study three](#study-three), i.e. how quickly do these frequencies come to mind?).

The results of the study indicate the presence of <b>two significant patterns</b>:

With regard to polarity, negative items (i.e. the more frequently they are performed, the more negatively they tend to be perceived) showed relatively low estimated values and decreased further as the scale moved from average to ideal. For positive items, the estimations were considerably higher on average.

Regarding normal and reasonable estimates: The <b><span style="color:forestgreen">normal estimates</span></b> were primarily influenced by the perception of what was considered <b><span style="color:navy">average</span></b>. For <b><span style="color:brown">reasonable estimates</span></b>, the picture was more balanced: participants appeared to accord equal weight to both <b><span style="color:navy">average</span> and <span style="color:orange">ideal</span></b> values in determining what felt reasonable.

    <b>In this graph, the x-axis is the normalized response scale, from 0, the lowest frequency estimate, to 1, the highest. The y-axis shows the cumulative distribution, which tells us the proportion of responses that fall below a given value. So, for example, if a curve reaches 0.5 on the y-axis at 0.25 on the x-axis, that means half of the responses were below 0.25 of the response.</b>

### Study two <img src="/assets/img/projects/preregistered.svg.png" width="34" style="transition: transform 0.3s; vertical-align: middle;" onmouseover="this.style.transform='scale(1.3)';" onmouseout="this.style.transform='scale(1)';" /> {#study-two}

<b>In our second study</b>, we explored <b>how people evaluate</b> average, ideal, normal, and reasonable frequencies. Participants were shown one value. This corresponded to one of the four properties. However, the participants <b>did not know which property they were evaluating</b>. They were just asked to rate how favourable or unfavourable they found the frequency for that specific item.

The results showed a clear differential evaluation of the four properties. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that <b><span style="color:navy">average frequencies</span> are the least well evaluated</b>, followed by neutrality/negativity towards <b><span style="color:forestgreen">normal frequencies</span></b>. In contrast, frequencies within the reasonable range are more likely to be evaluated favourably. A greater evaluation is observed for <span style="color:orange">ideal</span> frequencies.

The results of the second study indicate <b>two things</b>. Firstly, <b>moral expectations are similar for <span style="color:forestgreen">normal</span> and <span style="color:navy">average</span> frequencies</b>. Secondly, people are <b>less demanding when considering <span style="color:brown">reasonable</span> behaviours and events than <span style="color:orange">ideal</span> ones</b>. This suggests that people's perception of what is reasonable is an adjusted ideal, i.e. a contextual guideline that aligns with what would be ideal, but without all the unattainable demands (consistent with {%cite tobia2018reasonableness --locator 331 %}).

Lastly, in our third study, we explored how quickly people can retrieve or estimate different frequency judgements. Specifically, we investigated <b>how long it takes them to think about what is average, normal, reasonable or ideal</b> for a given behaviour or action. Do some of these properties take longer to retrieve than others? If so, what does this tell us about <b>how intuitive or accessible</b> each type of judgement is?

We found that <b><span style="color:orange">ideal</span> and <span style="color:navy">average</span></b> estimates were retrieved the fastest. However, it was surprising that there were <b>no statistically significant differences</b> in the time taken to retrieve ideal, average or <b><span style="color:brown">reasonable</span> frequencies</b>. In contrast, <b><span style="color:forestgreen">normal</span> estimates really stood out</b>; it consistently took longer to estimate these values.

Importantly, <b>reasonable was processed just as quickly as ideal and average, which may indicate that reasonable, though also hybrid, is more mentally accessible or clearly defined than normal</b>.
