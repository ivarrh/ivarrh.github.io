Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format. To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/storyboard.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    <b>Storyboard by Cognitive Media.</b>
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-sm" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/arow-figure.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    <b>Results of Validation Study (<i>N</i> = 804).</b>
</div>
