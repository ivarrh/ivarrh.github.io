The A-ROW (Animated Rules of the World) project investigates judgments of rule violation. As in previous work, we consider a rule as composed by its literal meaning (i.e., text) and its underlying spirit (or purpose). In this proof-of-concept, the key question is how the mode of administration influences response behavior, user experience, completion rates and the like. In collaboration with the team at [We are Cognitive](https://www.wearecognitive.com/whiteboard-animation-videos), we have developed an animated stimulus set for one rule (i.e., "No Dogs Allowed"). The storyboard in Figure 1 illustrates the key elements of the sequence: how the rule originated, a protagonist's behavior and the consequences of their behavior.

In our proof-of-concept studies, participants are assigned to either the animation-based or a text-based analogue in a between-subjects design. We will not only focus on participants’ violation judgments, but also on their subjective perception of the experiment, thus evaluating differences in experimental design from a qualitative standpoint.

Thus far, the results indicate that the magnitude of the effect sizes are strongly correlated across animation-based and text-based modes of delivery (see Figure 2A), _r_(22) = .93, _p_ < .001, providing initial validation of the method against the existing literature.

Follow-up questions about participants' experience indicate multiple preferences for the animation-based delivery: The animations are less boring (Cohen's _d_ = -0.28), less silly (Cohen's _d_ = 0.19), more entertaining (Cohen's _d_ = 0.29), more interesting (Cohen's _d_ = 0.29) and more engaging (Cohen's _d_ = 0.42) than text-based vignettes (Figure 2B), all *p*s < .001. Figure 2C also shows a lower expected payment among participants in the animation condition (_Mdn_ = £7.62 per hour) than in the text-based vignette (_Mdn_ = £11.00 per hour) condition (rank-sum test: _W_ = 100615, _p_ < .001).
