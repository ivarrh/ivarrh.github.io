PAOLO BUTTAZZONI.

My name is Paolo Buttazzoni and I am a junior researcher from Italy. I have obtained a bachelor’s degree in Cognitive Psychology & Psychobiology at the University of Padova, followed by a master’s double degree in Cognitive Neuroscience & Clinical Neuropsychology in collaboration with the University of Granada.

Pursuing my deep interest in ethics and artificial intelligence, I have taken part to multiple projects in the field, specialising in the use of moral dilemmas and the study of rule-based reasoning through a variety of methodologies and statistical approaches.

Both in my private and professional life, curiosity and perseverance have always driven me to achieve my goals, believing in the power of knowledge and its spread, because only what is truly shared is truly possessed.
