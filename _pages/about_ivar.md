<h3> Ivar Rodríguez HANNIKAINEN </h3>

I am the Principal Investigator of the Moral Science Lab. I received my PhD in Philosophy from the University of Sheffield (2014). After receiving my PhD, I held a postdoctoral position at the Department of Law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (2015-2016), a fellowship at Getulio Vargas Foundation (2016), and an assistant professorship in the Department of Law at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (2017-2019). I have been at the University of Granada since 2020, and currently hold a Ramón y Cajal fellowship (2022-).

Through my career, I have been heavily invested in interdisciplinary projects at the interface of philosophy, psychology and law. I have given invited lectures around the world at universities in the United States (Yale University, Harvard University), the United Kingdom (University of Oxford) Mexico (UNAM), Colombia (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), Morocco (Université Polytechnique Mohammed VI), Poland (Jagiellonian University) the Czech Republic (Charles University), Bulgaria (New Bulgarian University) and Romania (University of Bucharest). 

Outside academia, I enjoy sports, cooking and taking naps.
