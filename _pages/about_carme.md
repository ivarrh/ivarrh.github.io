<h3> Carme ISERN-MAS </h3> 

I am an assistant professor at the University of the Balearic Islands. Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Granada. I obtained my Ph.D. in Human Evolution and Cognition from the University of the Balearic Islands, after which I pursued a Masters in Philosophy at Florida State University. 

My research interests lie in the field of moral psychology, with a focus on topics such as blame, empathy, moral motivation and self-deception. I am also interested in applied ethics, particularly in mental health ethics.
