<h3> Carme ISERN-MAS </h3>

I am an assistant professor of moral philosophy at the University of the Balearic Islands, specializing in moral psychology and applied ethics. I hold an M.A. and a Ph.D. in Human Evolution and Cognition from the University of the Balearic Islands, and an M.A. in Philosophy from Florida State University.

My research interests lie in the field of moral psychology, with a focus on moral emotions and moral motivation. I am also interested in applied ethics, particularly in mental health ethics and the ethics of emotion.

Beyond research, I am proud of my slow but steady progress in climbing and calisthenics.
