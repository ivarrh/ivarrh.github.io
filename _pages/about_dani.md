Hi! My name is Daniel Martín, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Philosophy at the University of Granada. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy here at Granada, followed by a Master’s degree in Applied Ethics at the Complutense University of Madrid. I have also recently completed a Master’s degree in Teaching and am simultaneously pursuing a degree in Psychology at the UNED.

My research lies at the intersection of philosophy and moral psychology, focusing on the psychology behind everyday moral decisions relating to people, animals, and the environment. I combine philosophical analysis with experimental methods to explore these issues. For instance, one [project](/projects/practicalreason/) studies how people understand concepts like ‘normal’ and ‘reasonable’ and how this influences social and legal justification. Another [project](/projects/animaldilemmas) analyses the moral priority we attribute to different animals and plants and the implications for their rights and our duties of care.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time outdoors, cooking, walking my dogs, and occasionally going on hiking trips.
