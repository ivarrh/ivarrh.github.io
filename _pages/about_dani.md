Daniel MARTÍN.

I’m Daniel Martin, a PhD student at the University of Granada. I hold a Master’s degree in Applied Ethics from the Complutense University of Madrid and a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy from the University of Granada. My research focuses on how people form and justify their moral preferences, particularly regarding animals, plants, and other entities. I also investigate how perceptions of normality, reasonableness, and social norms influence moral prioritization and decision-making. Combining insights from philosophy and psychology, I use experimental methods to understand the processes behind moral reasoning, with the goal of informing ethical discussions in climate change and human-animal relationships.
