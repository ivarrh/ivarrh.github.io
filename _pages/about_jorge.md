JORGE SUÁREZ.

I'm Jorge Suárez, a PhD student at the University of Granada. Originally from Málaga, I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in Philosophy there, with a focus on Ethics. After finishing my training in Philosophy and Ethics, I decided that I wanted to become a Social Scientist to engage in research in Experimental and Empirical Ethics. To achieve this goal, I pursued another master's degree in Applied Sociology in Málaga.

Currently, I hold a position as a doctoral researcher in the Department of Philosophy I at the University of Granada, where I apply quantitative methods to explore various ethical and bioethical issues. My research topics range from migration studies to end-of-life and medical ethics.

In my private life, I am a proud caregiver of two lovely cats, and in my free time I enjoy reading—particularly historical fiction novels—and playing video games.
