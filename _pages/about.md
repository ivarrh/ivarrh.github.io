Welcome to our website! The Moral Science Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab based in the Department of Philosophy I at the University of Granada. We combine experimental and observational research methods to investigate issues in:

1. <b>philosophy</b>: Our research has examined the cognitive processes that subserve people's reasoning about various philosophical questions, such as the [compatibility between free will and determinism](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02428/full) or what it means to [be self-deceived](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-024-00743-y) or to [consent](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381715657_Agency_Desire_and_the_Conceptual_Representation_of_Consent).

2. <b>psychology</b>: Our ongoing studies examine how people reason about [the moral status of non-human species](/projects/animaldilemmas/), how we perceive non-native and [migrant individuals](/projects/migration/). We have also documented generational or [cohort differences](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-depends-if-you-re-a-millennial-or-not-1.4173661) in moral judgment.

3. <b>jurisprudence</b>: Some of our studies examine what people consider to be [law](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.13024), how they interpret rules, and how law and morality are [related](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2406823121).

You can learn more about our research on the [projects](/projects/) page. And also take one of our studies [here](/studies/)!
