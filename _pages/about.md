Welcome to our website! The Moral Science Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab based in the Department of Philosophy I at the University of Granada. We combine experimental and observational research methods to investigate a variety of issues...

1. <b>Philosophical Concepts</b>: the cognitive processes that subserve people's reasoning about philosophical questions, such as [whether free will and determinism are compatible](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02428/full) or what it means to [be self-deceived](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-024-00743-y) or to [consent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027725001301).

2. <b>Moral Psychology</b>: how people conceive the [moral status of non-human species](/projects/animaldilemmas/), how we perceive non-native and [migrant individuals](/projects/migration/). We have also documented generational or [cohort differences](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-depends-if-you-re-a-millennial-or-not-1.4173661) in moral judgment.

3. <b>Experimental Jurisprudence</b>: what people consider to be [law](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cogs.13024), how they interpret rules, and how law and morality are [related](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2406823121). Learn about experimental jurisprudence (<i>x-jur</i>) through the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/experimental-jurisprudence/).

Our research is described in greater detail on the [projects](/projects/) page. You can also take some of our studies [here](/studies/)!
