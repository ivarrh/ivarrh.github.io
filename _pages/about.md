The Moral Science Lab is fundamentally interdisciplinary, requiring the integration of three distinct academic disciplines and the collaboration between a network of scholars with complementary skill sets:

1. Normative ethics: at one level, objective of the MSIDLAB project is to advance normative ethical questions, such as, how to distinguish killing from letting die (see Rodriguez-Arias et al., 2020), or the proper standards for critical care triage (see Rueda et al., 2020).

2. Social and personality psychology: the MSIDLAB project draws heavily on the use of the experimental and quasi-experimental methods that have been developed in the psychological sciences (see Miller, Hannikainen & Cushman, 2014; Hannikainen, 2019).

3. Law and politics: the project sets out to employ the normative insights (distilled through a critical assessment of the cognitive science of moral disagreement) for the betterment of controversies arising in institutional context, such as the law (see, e.g. Struchiner, Almeida & Hannikainen, 2020, for an example of the role of empathy in judicial discretion).Welcome to my website!
