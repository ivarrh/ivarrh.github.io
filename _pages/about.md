The Moral Science Lab is an interdisciplinary research lab, based in the Department of Philosophy I at the University of Granada.

1. <b>Normative ethics</b>: at one level, objective of the Moral Science Lab is to advance normative ethical questions, such as, how to distinguish killing from letting die (see Rodriguez-Arias et al., 2020), or the proper standards for critical care triage (see Rueda et al., 2020).

2. <b>Social and personality psychology</b>: the Moral Science Lab draws heavily on the use of the experimental and quasi-experimental methods that have been developed in the psychological sciences (see Miller, Hannikainen & Cushman, 2014; Hannikainen, 2019).

3. <b>Law and politics</b>: the project sets out to employ the normative insights (distilled through a critical assessment of the cognitive science of moral disagreement) for the betterment of controversies arising in institutional context, such as the law (see, e.g. Struchiner, Almeida & Hannikainen, 2020, for an example of the role of empathy in judicial discretion).Welcome to my website!
