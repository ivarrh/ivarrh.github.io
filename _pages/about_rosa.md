<h3> Rosa LÓPEZ </h3>

I´m Rosa López, a PhD student at the University of Granada. I hold a degree in Business Administration and Management, and I am currently pursuing my doctorate in the same field. My research focuses on sustainable entrepreneurship, specifically examining the influence of contextual, organizational, and technological factors that drive companies to adopt or transform their business models toward sustainability. 

I currently hold a position as research assistant in the Department of Philosophy I at the University of Granada, where I contribute to various research initiatives. 

In my personal life, I love attending music festivals, practicing aikido, and enjoying life to the fullest.
