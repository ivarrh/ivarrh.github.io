<h3> Ismael MUELA </h3>

I hold a degree in Psychology from the University of Granada (UGR; 2009–2015), a Master’s in Neuroscience (specializing in Cognitive Neuroscience) from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM; 2015–2016), and a PhD in Psychology from the UGR (2019–2024). My doctoral dissertation focused on uncovering the basic mechanisms underlying emotion regulation in gambling disorder.

My research interests lie in the study of transdiagnostic markers of addictive processes, both substance-related and behavioral, as well as in understanding their etiology. In particular, I aim to shed light on the elusive construct of acquired compulsivity. Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher at the Moral Science Lab, I seek to contribute to the advancement of the group’s research agenda - while proving that psychologists and philosophers can, indeed, coexist.

In my free time, I am a frustrated powerlifter who loves eating (the spicier, the better), sleeping, and spending time with my loved ones.
